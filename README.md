# Effect-of-Caste-Category-on-Job-Occupation
With this paper, I aim to investigate if belonging to a backward caste category (SC, ST, OBC) imposes a
restriction on the kind of job opportunities available to that person. In other words, I want to understand if
Indians belonging to backward caste categories typically end up working as cooks, waiter, maids, sweepers,
drivers, miners, barbers etc. i.e. jobs which are deemed to be of lower esteem by our society. To infer this
I have used multi-level modelling and proportional odds model. My final model suggests that backward
caste categories face serious discrimination on the basis of caste which has a damaging effect on the job
opportunities available to them.
